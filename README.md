# 📊 Java Developer Internship – Task 5  
## Arrays & Basic Data Analysis Program


## 📌 Task Objective
The objective of this task is to build a **console-based data analysis application** using Java arrays.  
The program performs basic data analysis operations such as sum, average, minimum, maximum, manual sorting, and demonstrates both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays along with exception handling.


## 🛠 Tools Used
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  
- **Language:** Java  
- **JDK Version:** Java 17 / Java 21

## 🧩 Features Implemented
- Stores numerical data using **arrays**
- Performs:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
- Implements **manual sorting** (Bubble Sort) without built-in methods
- Demonstrates **single-dimensional (1D)** and **multi-dimensional (2D)** arrays
- Handles **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**
- Uses loops efficiently for array traversal
- Displays results using **formatted output**
- Includes clear inline comments for understanding


## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
Open terminal / command prompt in the `src` directory and run:

      ```bash
      javac ArrayDataAnalysis.java
      java ArrayDataAnalysis

      
## 💻 Sample Console Output

Enter number of elements: 5
Enter element 1: 10
Enter element 2: 5
Enter element 3: 20
Enter element 4: 8
Enter element 5: 15

--- Data Analysis Result ---
Sum: 58
Average: 11.60
Maximum: 20
Minimum: 5
Sorted Array: 5 8 10 15 20

2D Array Elements:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Accessing invalid index:
Exception caught: Array index out of bounds.


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understood how arrays are stored and accessed in memory

Learned difference between arrays and ArrayList

Implemented manual sorting algorithms

Practiced using 1D and 2D arrays

Learned how ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs

Improved logical thinking using loops and conditions

Strengthened Java fundamentals in data processing
